Mac OSX GNU Dependencies:
    Podget requires GNU Date, GNU Stat, GNU Sed, Coreutils (for expr) and Bash
    (at least version 4.4).  The easiest way to install them is to use Homebrew.
    For details on how to install and use Homebrew, please visit: https://brew.sh

    An updated version of Bash can be installed with: brew install bash

    GNU Date can be installed with: brew install gdate

    GNU Stat can be installed with: brew install gstat

    GNU Sed can be installed with: brew install gnu-sed

    And Coreutils can be installed with: brew install coreutils.

    Podget looks for the required binaries with a 'g' prefix.  This prefix is
    added automatically by brew with its default options.  The prefix can be
    overridden with the brew option '--with-default-names'.  However if you do
    this, it may be necessary that you add symbolic links from the brew
    installed sed to gsed and for the others.
