General Source Install:

    default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
    them as needed.


Building and installing a Debian package:
     $ cd podget-<version>
     $ fakeroot ./debian/rules binary
     $ cd ../
     $ sudo dpkg -i podget_<version>-all.deb

Mac OSX GNU Dependencies:
    Podget requires GNU Sed, Coreutils (for expr) and Bash (at least version
    4.4).  The easiest way to install them is to use Homebrew.  For details on
    how to install and use Homebrew, please visit: https://brew.sh

    An updated version of Bash can be installed with: brew install bash

    GNU Sed can be installed with: brew install gnu-sed

    And Coreutils can be installed with: brew install coreutils.

    Podget looks for the required binaries with a 'g' prefix.  This prefix is
    added automatically by brew with its default options.  The prefix can be
    overridden with the brew option '--with-default-names'.  However if you do
    this, it may be necessary that you add symbolic links from the brew
    installed sed to gsed and from the brew installed expr to gexpr.

FreeBSD Dependencies and Install:
    Podget requires a few things that are not part of a default installation.

    As root (or with doas) using 'pkg install' add:
      - bash (at least version 4.4)
      - wget
      - coreutils
      - gsed
      - gnustat
        gmake
      - ca_root_nss
          NOTE: pkg will be automatically installed the first time you attempt
                to use it.

    Source Install:
      $ gmake
      $ doas gmake install OR su root -c 'gmake install'

      After the package is installed, run it once to install
      default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
      them as needed.

    Tested on: FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE GENERIC amd64

NetBSD Dependencies and Install:
    Podget requires a few things that are not part of a default installation.

    As root (or with doas) using pkg_add install:
      - bash (at least version 4.4)
      - wget
      - ca-certificates
      - coreutils
      - gsed
      - gmake

    Source Install:
      $ gmake
      $ doas gmake install OR su root -c 'gmake install'

      After the package is installed, run it once to install
      default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
      them as needed.

    Note: During testing I noticed that there were several feeds that had small
          issues I did not see while testing other operating systems.  These
          issues were resolved by enabling the --no-check-certificate and the
          --prefer-family=IPv4 options for wget.  These issues may have been
          caused by local configuration choices but its what I experienced for
          what it's worth.
