General Source Install:
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

    After the package is installed, run it once to install
    default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
    them as needed.


Building and installing a Debian package:
     $ cd podget-<version>
     $ fakeroot ./debian/rules binary
     $ cd ../
     $ sudo dpkg -i podget_<version>-all.deb

Mac OSX GNU Dependencies:
    Podget requires GNU Date, GNU Stat, GNU Sed, Coreutils (for expr) and Bash
    (at least version 4.4).  The easiest way to install them is to use Homebrew.
    For details on how to install and use Homebrew, please visit: https://brew.sh

    An updated version of Bash can be installed with: brew install bash

    GNU Date can be installed with: brew install gdate

    GNU Stat can be installed with: brew install gstat

    GNU Sed can be installed with: brew install gnu-sed

    And Coreutils can be installed with: brew install coreutils.

    Podget looks for the required binaries with a 'g' prefix.  This prefix is
    added automatically by brew with its default options.  The prefix can be
    overridden with the brew option '--with-default-names'.  However if you do
    this, it may be necessary that you add symbolic links from the brew
    installed sed to gsed and for the others.

    Additionally installing packages with brew may require some changes to the
    PATH variable setting described below.

FreeBSD Dependencies and Install:
    Podget requires a few things that are not part of a default installation.

    As root (or with doas) using 'pkg install' add:
      - bash (at least version 4.4)
      - wget
      - coreutils
      - gsed
        gmake
      - ca_root_nss
          NOTE: pkg will be automatically installed the first time you attempt
                to use it.
      - gnustat
          NOTE: When testing with FreeBSD 13.1, gnustat was part of the 
                coreutils package and so did not require a separate install.

    Source Install:
      $ gmake
      $ doas gmake install OR su root -c 'gmake install'

      After the package is installed, run it once to install
      default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
      them as needed.

    Tested on: FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE GENERIC amd64

NetBSD Dependencies and Install:

      - wget
      - ca-certificates
      - coreutils
      - gsed
      - gmake

    Source Install:
      $ gmake
      $ doas gmake install OR su root -c 'gmake install'

      After the package is installed, run it once to install
      default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
      them as needed.

    Tested on: NetBSD 9.3 (GENERIC) #0 amd64

OpenBSD Dependencies and Install:
    Podget requires a few things that are not part of a default installation.

      - coreutils
      - gsed
      - gmake

    Source Install:
      $ gmake
      $ doas gmake install OR su root -c 'gmake install'

      After the package is installed, run it once to install
      default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
      them as needed.

    Tested on: OpenBSD 6.7 GENERIC#179 amd64

Crontab Potential Issue:
    Occasionally when you install Podget, it will run fine from the shell prompt
    but experiences a problem when you attempt to run it as a cron job.  When this
    happens it may be caused by Podget not being able to find every command
    it needs.  This can be caused by differences in the PATH variable which
    contains a list of directories to search for commands.  This list is
    delimited by colons and read from left to right so if a command of the same
    name exists in two directories, the one you want should be read first.

    An example of this happened on MacOS.  What we discovered was that for
    cronjobs the PATH variable was set to "/usr/bin:/bin" which may be a
    sensible default but lacked a few directories we needed.  On MacOS, there are
    a few applications that can be useful to determine what we need to add to
    the PATH variable.  Those applications are gexpr, gdate, gsed and gstat.  We
    can use the which, whereis or find commands to determine where they are on
    our system.  On the system we were having a problem with, we discovered that
    some of these applications were in /opt/local/bin and others were in
    /usr/local/bin so we needed to add those directories to our PATH variable
    for Podget to work.

    So we changed our cronjob from:
      15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget -s
    To:
      15 04 * * * PATH=/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH /usr/bin/podget -s

    If you wish to see the differences in how PATH is configured:
        FOR THE SHELL: Simply run "echo $PATH"
        FOR A CRONJOB:
            1.  Create simple shell script  /tmp/test_cron.sh which contains:
                #!/usr/bin/env bash
                echo "PATH: $PATH"
            2. Configure a cronjob to run the script with "crontab -e"
                * * * * * /tmp/test_cron.sh > /tmp/test_cron.out
                NOTE:  This job will run every minute so disable it as soon as
                       it has run once or twice.
            3. Open the file /tmp/test_cron.out in an editor to see how it has
               the PATH variable configured.
