podget (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium
    Added support for converting <TITLE> from RSS feeds to the filename for
    each downloaded item.  For some feeds this will result in more descriptive
    filenames than the default filename.  For others it will make little
    difference and for some the names will be worse.  Whether or not to enable
    the option is left up to the user.

    For feeds that you will to use it on there are two options.

    The first is OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG and that is for feeds when the
    <TITLE> tag proceeds the <ENCLOSURE> tag.  For the vast majority of feeds
    this will be the option you want.

    The second is OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG which is for feeds where the
    <ENCLOSURE> tag proceeds the <TITLE> tag.

    To enable either option just add them to the configuration line for the
    feed in your serverlist file.  For more examples, refer to:  man podget

podget (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium
    Added support for Atom feeds.  Format of serverlist remains the same with
    the addition of a few options for them.  If you'd care to view the
    possibilities then generate a new serverlist with:

        podget --serverlist [New-List-Name]

    If you'd rather just continue with support for your existing feeds, then
    no changes are necessary.

podget (0.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Modified configuration file format.  By default, this file is stored in
    $HOME/.podget/podgetrc.  To continue using podget, this file will need to be
    updated to the new format.  If it is not updated, any attempt to run podget
    will notify the user that the file needs to be updated and then exit.

    To update the configuration file, follow these steps:
        1.  Create new configuration file.
              podget --create-config podgetrc.new
        2.  Use your favorite editor to compare it to your old configuration
            file and modify its configuration to match yours.
              cd $HOME/.podget
              vimdiff podgetrc podgetrc.new
        3. Once the configuration has been transferred into the new format,
           rename or move the files.
              mv podgetrc podgetrc.old
              mv podgetrc.new podgetrc
        4. Once you verify that the new configuration file works as expected,
           you can delete the old version.
              rm podgetrc.old

    If you run multiple sessions of podget with different configurations then you
    will need to update each configuration file or when you attempt to run
    podget with any old version of the configuration file, it will display the
    need to update and then exit.
